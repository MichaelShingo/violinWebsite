        ensemble: ['violin', 'piano'],
        description: 'shinrin-yoku, or “forest bathing,” is a Japanese word referring to the activity of spending time in natural surroundings. It is a way of escaping the indoor life that is a reality for many people—a lifestyle concomitant with a constant onslaught of messages, a jungle of digital screens, and an overwhelming busyness that permits the mind no respite. The music takes the listener through this journey of shinrin-yoku, from the point of entering the forest and taking in its beauty to finding peace in a gentle meditative state.',

        title: 'Bicycle',
        ensemble: ['bassoon', 'piano'],
        description: 'This piece explores a bicycle’s gear mechanism through overlapping lines that move at differing rates. In the opening passage, the bassoon plays a figure in 5/8, over which the piano sounds a repeating chord in a dotted eighth-note rhythm. The faster motion in the bassoon part signifies a bicyclist pedaling in a low gear, in which the rapid pedal motion translates to a slower rotation of the tires. This concept of fast input and slow output is a central aspect of the piece and helps produce many of the contrapuntal ideas that pervade the music. There is a mechanistic feeling produced by the relentless, driving rhythms, but this is accompanied by more organic elements such as the longer lines that sing above the mechanical pulse. This reflects the perspective and experience of the bicyclist, who powers the machine but is a different entity entirely.',

        ensemble: ['wind quintet', 'flute', 'oboe', 'bassoon', 'clarinet', 'horn'],
        description: 'Agnostic Symbol is inspired by Salvador Dalí’s painting of the same name. A desolate landscape opens before the viewer, and a distended spoon emerges from the distance. Carrying a miniscule clock, the spoon stretches across the canvas, contorting itself around a rock formation, representing humanity, and continuing further. This painting may be interpreted as an opposition between the longing for eternal life and the reality that life is finite. The spoon attempts to feed the reality of finitude to the stone, but misses the mark, leaving humanity steeped in its longing. Rather than attempting to recreate and represent the painting through sound, this music expresses the overall impression and emotional content of the image. There is a pervasive sense of desolation, especially in the sparsely orchestrated opening and closing sections. The middle of the piece expresses conflict and anguish through highly active and unstable textures.',

        description: 'The text for Wistful Autumn Nights draws from Clay MacCauley’s English translation of Ogura Hyakunin-Isshu. These 100 Japanese poems, written by 100 different poets living as early as the 7th century, were compiled in 1235 by Fujiwara no Teika. The subjects of these tanka, consisting of a 5-7-5-7-7 syllabic structure, explore ordinary emotions, love, and an admiration for nature. This song cycle includes five poems concerning wistfulness in autumn. The sentiments expressed are subtle: the sadness is never maudlin and happiness not ecstatic. Instead, they capture with beautiful succinctness a fleeting scene—a snapshot of human experience.',

        title: 'Blossoms in the Dead of Winter',
        ensemble: ['piano trio', 'violin', 'piano', 'cello'],
        description: 'Blossoms in the Dead of Winter is inspired by the imagery found in a scene from the 2005 anime series, Mushishi, where an enclave of spring opens up in the heart of a blizzard. The wanderer in the mountains finds refuge in this oasis of life while enveloped by the desolation of the winter storm. Is this miraculous presence grounded in reality, or is it a mirage induced by his intense longing for warmth? This juxtaposition of polar opposites produces a surrealistic effect. The second theme quotes from the Japanese folk song “Sakura, Sakura.” Its text describes cherry blossoms blown around by the wind as far as the eye can see. It poses the question, “Is it mist, or clouds?” Seen from afar, these blossoms impress on the viewer a concept of an entirely different entity. This ambiguity of form derived from a spontaneous conception that the viewer constructs of the scene before him links the subject of the folk song with an impressionistic mode of visualization. The pitch content of the song further bolsters this idea, as it is derived from the Japanese mode, a variant of the pentatonic scale. The melody, which outlines a tritone, implies harmonies such as the half-diminished seventh chord and otherwise evokes a sense of tonal ambiguity. The incorporation of this melody into the piano trio thus brings with it harmonic and timbral implications. The melodies constantly shift between distant modes, and their harmonization only exacerbates this instability. Accompanying whole tone and octatonic scales color these modal lines. The first section of the piece presents the initial melodic idea which represents a subdued, wintry character. Throughout this section, the initial fragment of the Sakura melody repeatedly appears in the left hand of the piano part before the first full presentation occurs in the bassline. The character intensifies like a brewing storm, and the Sakura melody appears a second time but in syncopation, almost as if the whirlwind of icy particles called cherry blossoms to mind. The middle section dominated by a clear melody in the violin provides a short-lived respite from the storm. The next section contains the most complete and extensive presentation of the “Sakura” melody, signifying the arrival at the oasis of spring; however, the sinuous sixteenth notes weaving through the uneven meter of the violin line keeps this from becoming a resting place. The turbulent character gradually creeps in, culminating in the most tumultuous and contrapuntally dense area of the piece. This extroverted outburst is subsequently reduced to a more contained expression that maintains the tension despite its subdued character. The material from the opening section returns before the piece draws to a close in a flurry of activity, leaving the traveler’s fate uncertain.',

        title: 'Parallax',
        ensemble: ['piano'],
        description: 'This composition explores the concept of parallax, the perceived difference in the position of multiple objects seen along different lines of sight. For example, when the viewer of two objects is in motion, the one that is farther away appears to move more slowly than the one that is closer. This piece draws musical equivalences in various ways. The opening section is played freely, as if improvised, and overlaps parts that move at different tempi. The music then transitions into a more metered section which features polymeter and hemiolas embedded within lines that form cross-rhythms with each other. After a rhapsodic interlude, the music settles into a repeated 9/16 figure that is paired with a constant stream of sixteenth notes, beginning with a two-note pattern and undergoing an additive process. The three highest notes of the 9/16 figure become isolated and rhythmically modulate, transforming into the repeated note idea heard in the opening of the piece.',
