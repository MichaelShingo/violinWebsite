It is a way of escaping the indoor life that is a reality for many people—a lifestyle concomitant with a constant onslaught of messages, a jungle of digital screens, and an overwhelming busyness that permits the mind no respite. The music takes the listener through this journey of shinrin-yoku, from the point of entering the forest and taking in its beauty to finding peace in a gentle meditative state.',

        description: 'This piece explores a bicycle’s gear mechanism through overlapping lines that move at differing rates. In the opening passage, the bassoon plays a figure in 5/8, over which the piano sounds a repeating chord in a dotted eighth-note rhythm. The faster motion in the bassoon part signifies a bicyclist pedaling in a low gear, in which the rapid pedal motion translates to a slower rotation of the tires. This concept of fast input and slow output is a central aspect of the piece and helps produce many of the contrapuntal ideas that pervade the music. There is a mechanistic feeling produced by the relentless, driving rhythms, but this is accompanied by more organic elements such as the longer lines that sing above the mechanical pulse. This reflects the perspective and experience of the bicyclist, who powers the machine but is a different entity entirely.',

Carrying a miniscule clock, the spoon stretches across the canvas, contorting itself around a rock formation, representing humanity, and continuing further. This painting may be interpreted as an opposition between the longing for eternal life and the reality that life is finite. The spoon attempts to feed the reality of finitude to the stone, but misses the mark, leaving humanity steeped in its longing. Rather than attempting to recreate and represent the painting through sound, this music expresses the overall impression and emotional content of the image. There is a pervasive sense of desolation, especially in the sparsely orchestrated opening and closing sections. The middle of the piece expresses conflict and anguish through highly active and unstable textures.',

The subjects of these tanka, consisting of a 5-7-5-7-7 syllabic structure, explore ordinary emotions, love, and an admiration for nature. This song cycle includes five poems concerning wistfulness in autumn. The sentiments expressed are subtle: the sadness is never maudlin and happiness not ecstatic.

        title: 'Blossoms in the Dead of Winter',
        ensemble: ['piano trio', 'violin', 'piano', 'cello'],
        description: 'Blossoms in the Dead of Winter is inspired by the imagery found in a scene from the 2005 anime series, Mushishi, where an enclave of spring opens up in the heart of a blizzard. The wanderer in the mountains finds refuge in this oasis of life while enveloped by the desolation of the winter storm. Is this miraculous presence grounded in reality, or is it a mirage induced by his intense longing for warmth? This juxtaposition of polar opposites produces a surrealistic effect. The second theme quotes from the Japanese folk song “Sakura, Sakura.” Its text describes cherry blossoms blown around by the wind as far as the eye can see. It poses the question, “Is it mist, or clouds?” Seen from afar, these blossoms impress on the viewer a concept of an entirely different entity. This ambiguity of form derived from a spontaneous conception that the viewer constructs of the scene before him links the subject of the folk song with an impressionistic mode of visualization. The pitch content of the song further bolsters this idea, as it is derived from the Japanese mode, a variant of the pentatonic scale. The melody, which outlines a tritone, implies harmonies such as the half-diminished seventh chord and otherwise evokes a sense of tonal ambiguity. The incorporation of this melody into the piano trio thus brings with it harmonic and timbral implications. The melodies constantly shift between distant modes, and their harmonization only exacerbates this instability. Accompanying whole tone and octatonic scales color these modal lines. The first section of the piece presents the initial melodic idea which represents a subdued, wintry character. Throughout this section, the initial fragment of the Sakura melody repeatedly appears in the left hand of the piano part before the first full presentation occurs in the bassline. The character intensifies like a brewing storm, and the Sakura melody appears a second time but in syncopation, almost as if the whirlwind of icy particles called cherry blossoms to mind. The middle section dominated by a clear melody in the violin provides a short-lived respite from the storm. The next section contains the most complete and extensive presentation of the “Sakura” melody, signifying the arrival at the oasis of spring; however, the sinuous sixteenth notes weaving through the uneven meter of the violin line keeps this from becoming a resting place. The turbulent character gradually creeps in, culminating in the most tumultuous and contrapuntally dense area of the piece. This extroverted outburst is subsequently reduced to a more contained expression that maintains the tension despite its subdued character. The material from the opening section returns before the piece draws to a close in a flurry of activity, leaving the traveler’s fate uncertain.',

For example, when the viewer of two objects is in motion, the one that is farther away appears to move more slowly than the one that is closer. This piece draws musical equivalences in various ways. The opening section is played freely, as if improvised, and overlaps parts that move at different tempi. The music then transitions into a more metered section which features polymeter and hemiolas embedded within lines that form cross-rhythms with each other. After a rhapsodic interlude, the music settles into a repeated 9/16 figure that is paired with a constant stream of sixteenth notes, beginning with a two-note pattern and undergoing an additive process. The three highest notes of the 9/16 figure become isolated and rhythmically modulate, transforming into the repeated note idea heard in the opening of the piece.',

        title: 'Derive III',
        ensemble: ['flute', 'piano'],
        description: `Derive turns to equations and differential calculus for pitch material. The first movement uses the equation f(x)=0.5x^3- 〖0.5x〗^2-10x. This function may represent the position of an object at any point in time, hence the name of the movement. Integer inputs in the range -6 to 5 produce a sequence of numbers that can be converted into pitches. The resulting series of pitches, with the contour of a graphed cubic equation, appear in fragmented forms in the opening of the piece, developing towards a complete statement at the end of the first section. The second movement is based on f'(x)=1.5x^2- x-10, the first derivative of the original equation. This function calculates instantaneous velocity, the rate of change in the position of the object at any moment in time. This movement applies the equation more loosely—rather than extrapolating exact pitches based on the outputs, it merely replicates the parabolic contour of the graphed function. f''(x)=3x- 1, the second derivative, serves as the basis for the third movement. This function tracks acceleration, or the rate of change in velocity. For each integer inputted, the resulting value is three greater than the previous one. This may be represented musically through a fully diminished seventh chord which consists of four pitches spaced three semitones apart. Two of these chords transposed and superimposed produce the octatonic scale, with alternating half steps and whole steps. These are the chordal and scalar materials around which the third movement revolves. The overlapping rising lines of varying lengths create a sense of constant ascent, alluding to the linear function’s infinitude.`,

        description: 'Portraits is a string quartet in which each of the four movements is a depiction of one of the principal string players of Emory University Symphony Orchestra as of Fall 2015. D.K., concertmaster, opens the quartet with its exuberant character. The contour of its initial motif, across all of the instruments, outlines the letter “D.” This idea is featured again at the return of the A section but now delineating the letter “K,” thus spelling out the initials “D.K.” An uninterrupted stream of eighth notes serves as the driving force behind the A section, which features succinct motifs and brief shifts to distant tonalities. At the end of this section, the ideas introduced previously are fragmented and distributed across all four instruments, taking advantage of the spatial arrangement of the quartet and creating a sense of instability by making it difficult to predict the location from which the next fragment will emerge. After the contrasting middle section, the opening material returns, relaxing into a calmer character and leading into the second movement. A.B., principal cello, seeks to convey enveloping warmth. While the cello is often in the foreground, all of the instruments have independent lines that interweave with its melody. The movement concludes with a fragmentation of the opening melody in the upper voices with a metrically contrasting figure in the cello line. M.K., principal viola, is quirky and joyfully effervescent. It features an unusual and rather humorous use of glissandi in the second violin part and often creates harmonic structure based on the simultaneous presence of two modes. The movement concludes with a section driven by ostinati across all instruments, each of which is in a different meter. M.S.C., as principal second violin, is a self-portrait. There is a sense of restlessness and forward drive in this movement accomplished through much more dissonant harmonies based on stacked intervals, particularly the seventh, as a method of building chords. M.S.C. makes countless motivic references to the previous movements, emphasizing the role that each of the people portrayed have played in my life. The quartet comes to a close with a coda, where the defining motifs for each portrait are localized to their respective instruments.',

        description: 'teru teru bouzu is a resetting of the text from a Japanese children’s song of the same name. The lyrics speak of teru teru bouzu, a handmade doll crafted by children that is believed to bring good weather. While it is not often sung, the final line, “Then I’ll cut off your head, snip!” brings an unexpectedly dark turn to the song. This becomes the focal point of the reimagined music. The text now becomes sinister and foreboding with the implication of a crazed mental state. Rather than a child wishing for clear weather on the following day, the narrative transforms into that of a woman, steeped in superstition, desperately making offerings to the teru teru bouzu to grant her wish. The opening section sets the atmosphere of the piece. The voice sings fragmented sounds from the first line of text, which meld into the textural effects produced by the instruments. Motivic fragments from the original song begin to appear as well. The clarinet cadenza marks a transition into the second section and the setting of the first stanza. Following this, the music reflects on what has been said with isolated portions of the text interspersed. With the onset of the second stanza, the music reaches a point of greater energy and faster tempo. The singer’s offering of “sweet sake” to the teru teru bouzu comes with a sense of drunken revelry, reinforced by quotations of Camille Saint-Saëns’ Bacchanale from Samson and Delilah. The soprano becomes increasingly insistent in her demands with the obsessive repetition of “kiite” (“listen!”) before the instruments erupt into a climactic return of opening material, leading into the final stanza. The music now retreats into hushed tones with an intensifying menacing quality. The incorporation of quarter tones and glissandi represent a bending and breaking of the singer’s sanity. With an onomatopoetic “chon!” she threatens beheading in a rather Berliozian manner. In the final aleatoric passage, the instruments produce sounds that imitate rain, implying that the teru teru bouzu failed to grant her wish.',

Best described as a melancholy or wistfulness toward the transient nature of objects and life in general, it is a cultural concept that does not have an equivalent in the English language. A constantly shifting meter, suggesting impermanence, is strung together by a sustained stream of sixteenth notes in the piano part. The idea of growth and withering away are built into the piece through a metrical process involving a repeating melodic idea. The initial form of the idea, comprised exclusively of sixteenth notes, is altered through the addition or subtraction of a single note. In this manner, what was at first a fourteen-note idea is reduced to thirteen, then twelve, and continues to wither away until the process is halted by the introduction of a different idea. Polymeter features prominently in the music\'s construction, often putting the violin’s metric organization at odds with the divisions in the piano part.',

The concurrence of contrasting pitch collections and meters expresses the conflict between the purely mental imagery of the dream and the corporeal world that lies awaiting the sleeper’s wake. The motivic material is passed between the two parts and presented in several variations throughout the piece. The music pensively draws to a close, reflecting on the inevitability of awakening and the dreamer’s melancholy at the thought of abandoning the fantastical journey that will soon fade into oblivion.',
